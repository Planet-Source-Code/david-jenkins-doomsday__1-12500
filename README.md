## Doomsday


</div>

### Description

Determine the day of any date in history by knowing only 5 numbers! This is a coding implementation of the doomsday algorithm created by British mathematician John Conway. The method is clearly explained and includes several examples. With a little practice, you can determine the day of any date in history in your head in less than 20 seconds. May not always be very useful, but its a pretty slick trick.
